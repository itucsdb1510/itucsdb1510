User Guide
==========
In project we consider to create a website about bicycling which users can share their experiences, compete with each other, sell or buy bikes, keep in touch with news from all over the World. Also they can socialize with several social activities.

For our project, we need some classes. Basically these classes are listed as Activity, Race, Team, Admin, ProfessionalUser, BasicUser, Cycroutes, Experience, Bike, Forum, Announcement, Topic, Comment, News.

In this document we aimed to give users brief information about how our website works from the external perspective.
